This is a project built for a YouTube video. Just a simple prototype, not a full fledged, production ready application.

if you're interested, check out the video to get better understanding on what it really is.

This code is a bit of a mess, since it started as an express server project and eventually graduated to a firebase function. So there might be some left overs from the express version.
